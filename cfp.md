2022 SIGBIT Workshop on Web3 Technologies and Applications

December 11, 2022, Copenhagen, Denmark

(in conjunction with [International Conference on Information Systems](https://icis2022.aisconferences.org/)) 

Blockchain technology is flourishing into a wide spectrum of academic and industrial initiatives in many fields such as banking, insurance, manufacturing, supply chain, education, healthcare, government, etc. As a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain, Web3 has gained a lot of attention in recent years, which revolves around blockchain based technologies and applications such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs), and Metaverse. Many have argued that Web3 can be a potential solution to the over-centralization of data and content in the Web 2.0 era, while others have expressed concerns about the regulation issues and new data ownership problems in a decentralized web.

- Decentralized Finance
